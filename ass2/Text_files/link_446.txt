Content :Source code: Lib/xml/sax/saxutils.py
The module xml.sax.saxutils contains a number of classes and functions
that are commonly useful when creating SAX applications, either in direct use,
or as base classes.
Escape '&', '<', and '>' in a string of data.
You can escape other strings of data by passing a dictionary as the optional
entities parameter.  The keys and values must all be strings; each key will be
replaced with its corresponding value.  The characters '&', '<' and
'>' are always escaped, even if entities is provided.
Unescape '&amp;', '&lt;', and '&gt;' in a string of data.
You can unescape other strings of data by passing a dictionary as the optional
entities parameter.  The keys and values must all be strings; each key will be
replaced with its corresponding value.  '&amp', '&lt;', and '&gt;'
are always unescaped, even if entities is provided.
Similar to escape(), but also prepares data to be used as an
attribute value.  The return value is a quoted version of data with any
additional required replacements. quoteattr() will select a quote
character based on the content of data, attempting to avoid encoding any
quote characters in the string.  If both single- and double-quote characters
are already in data, the double-quote characters will be encoded and data
will be wrapped in double-quotes.  The resulting string can be used directly
as an attribute value:
This function is useful when generating attribute values for HTML or any SGML
using the reference concrete syntax.
This class implements the ContentHandler interface
by writing SAX
events back into an XML document. In other words, using an XMLGenerator
as the content handler will reproduce the original document being parsed. out
should be a file-like object which will default to sys.stdout. encoding is
the encoding of the output stream which defaults to 'iso-8859-1'.
short_empty_elements controls the formatting of elements that contain no
content:  if False (the default) they are emitted as a pair of start/end
tags, if set to True they are emitted as a single self-closed tag.
New in version 3.2: The short_empty_elements parameter.
This class is designed to sit between an
XMLReader and the client
application’s event handlers.  By default, it does nothing but pass requests up
to the reader and events on to the handlers unmodified, but subclasses can
override specific methods to modify the event stream or the configuration
requests as they pass through.
This function takes an input source and an optional base URL and returns a
fully resolved InputSource object ready for
reading.  The input source can be given as a string, a file-like object, or
an InputSource object; parsers will use this
function to implement the polymorphic source argument to their
parse() method.
