Content :The type object for slice objects.  This is the same as slice in the
Python layer.
Return true if ob is a slice object; ob must not be NULL.
Return a new slice object with the given values.  The start, stop, and
step parameters are used as the values of the slice object attributes of
the same names.  Any of the values may be NULL, in which case the
None will be used for the corresponding attribute.  Return NULL if
the new object could not be allocated.
Retrieve the start, stop and step indices from the slice object slice,
assuming a sequence of length length. Treats indices greater than
length as errors.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error with no exception set (unless one of
the indices was not None and failed to be converted to an integer,
in which case -1 is returned with an exception set).
You probably do not want to use this function.
Changed in version 3.2: The parameter type for the slice parameter was PySliceObject*
before.
Usable replacement for PySlice_GetIndices().  Retrieve the start,
stop, and step indices from the slice object slice assuming a sequence of
length length, and store the length of the slice in slicelength.  Out
of bounds indices are clipped in a manner consistent with the handling of
normal slices.
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error with exception set.
Changed in version 3.2: The parameter type for the slice parameter was PySliceObject*
before.
