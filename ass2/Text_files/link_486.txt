Content :Source code: Lib/tabnanny.py
For the time being this module is intended to be called as a script. However it
is possible to import it into an IDE and use the function check()
described below.
Note
The API provided by this module is likely to change in future releases; such
changes may not be backward compatible.
If file_or_dir is a directory and not a symbolic link, then recursively
descend the directory tree named by file_or_dir, checking all .py
files along the way.  If file_or_dir is an ordinary Python source file, it
is checked for whitespace related problems.  The diagnostic messages are
written to standard output using the print() function.
Flag indicating whether to print verbose messages. This is incremented by the
-v option if called as a script.
Flag indicating whether to print only the filenames of files containing
whitespace related problems.  This is set to true by the -q option if called
as a script.
Raised by tokeneater() if detecting an ambiguous indent. Captured and
handled in check().
This function is used by check() as a callback parameter to the function
tokenize.tokenize().
