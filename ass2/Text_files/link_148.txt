Content :Source code: Lib/binhex.py
This module encodes and decodes files in binhex4 format, a format allowing
representation of Macintosh files in ASCII. Only the data fork is handled.
The binhex module defines the following functions:
Convert a binary file with filename input to binhex file output. The
output parameter can either be a filename or a file-like object (any object
supporting a write() and close() method).
Decode a binhex file input. input may be a filename or a file-like object
supporting read() and close() methods. The resulting file is written
to a file named output, unless the argument is None in which case the
output filename is read from the binhex file.
The following exception is also defined:
Exception raised when something can’t be encoded using the binhex format (for
example, a filename is too long to fit in the filename field), or when input is
not properly encoded binhex data.

There is an alternative, more powerful interface to the coder and decoder, see
the source for details.
If you code or decode textfiles on non-Macintosh platforms they will still use
the old Macintosh newline convention (carriage-return as end of line).
As of this writing, hexbin() appears to not work in all cases.
