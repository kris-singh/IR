Python’s interfaces for processing XML are grouped in the xml package.
Warning
The XML modules are not secure against erroneous or maliciously
constructed data.  If you need to parse untrusted or
unauthenticated data see the XML vulnerabilities and
The defusedxml and defusedexpat Packages sections.
It is important to note that modules in the xml package require that
there be at least one SAX-compliant XML parser available. The Expat parser is
included with Python, so the xml.parsers.expat module will always be
available.
The documentation for the xml.dom and xml.sax packages are the
definition of the Python bindings for the DOM and SAX interfaces.
The XML handling submodules are:
The XML processing modules are not secure against maliciously constructed data.
An attacker can abuse XML features to carry out denial of service attacks,
access local files, generate network connections to other machines, or
circumvent firewalls.
The following table gives an overview of the known attacks and whether
the various modules are vulnerable to them.
The documentation for defusedxml on PyPI has further information about
all known attack vectors with examples and references.
defusedxml is a pure Python package with modified subclasses of all stdlib
XML parsers that prevent any potentially malicious operation. Use of this
package is recommended for any server code that parses untrusted XML data. The
package also ships with example exploits and extended documentation on more
XML exploits such as XPath injection.
defusedexpat provides a modified libexpat and a patched
pyexpat module that have countermeasures against entity expansion
DoS attacks. The defusedexpat module still allows a sane and configurable amount of entity
expansions. The modifications may be included in some future release of Python,
but will not be included in any bugfix releases of
Python because they break backward compatibility.
