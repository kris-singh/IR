Content :Tk/Tcl has long been an integral part of Python.  It provides a robust and
platform independent windowing toolkit, that is available to Python programmers
using the tkinter package, and its extension, the tkinter.tix and
the tkinter.ttk modules.
The tkinter package is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. To
use tkinter, you don’t need to write Tcl code, but you will need to
consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally the Tcl documentation.
tkinter is a set of wrappers that implement the Tk widgets as Python
classes.  In addition, the internal module _tkinter provides a threadsafe
mechanism which allows Python and Tcl to interact.
tkinter‘s chief virtues are that it is fast, and that it usually comes
bundled with Python. Although its standard documentation is weak, good
material is available, which includes: references, tutorials, a book and
others. tkinter is also famous for having an outdated look and feel,
which has been vastly improved in Tk 8.5. Nevertheless, there are many other
GUI libraries that you could be interested in. For more information about
alternatives, see the Other Graphical User Interface Packages section.
