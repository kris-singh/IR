The imghdr module determines the type of image contained in a file or
byte stream.
The imghdr module defines the following function:
Tests the image data contained in the file named by filename, and returns a
string describing the image type.  If optional h is provided, the filename
is ignored and h is assumed to contain the byte stream to test.
The following image types are recognized, as listed below with the return value
from what():
New in version 3.5: The exr and webp formats were added.
You can extend the list of file types imghdr can recognize by appending
to this variable:
A list of functions performing the individual tests.  Each function takes two
arguments: the byte-stream and an open file-like object. When what() is
called with a byte-stream, the file-like object will be None.
The test function should return a string describing the image type if the test
succeeded, or None if it failed.
Example:
22.6. colorsys — Conversions between color systems
22.8. sndhdr — Determine type of sound file
