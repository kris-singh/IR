Content :The winsound module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery
provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several constants.
Beep the PC’s speaker. The frequency parameter specifies frequency, in hertz,
of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The duration
parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last.  If the
system is not able to beep the speaker, RuntimeError is raised.
Call the underlying PlaySound() function from the Platform API.  The
sound parameter may be a filename, audio data as a string, or None.  Its
interpretation depends on the value of flags, which can be a bitwise ORed
combination of the constants described below. If the sound parameter is
None, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system
indicates an error, RuntimeError is raised.
Call the underlying MessageBeep() function from the Platform API.  This
plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The type argument specifies which
sound to play; possible values are -1, MB_ICONASTERISK,
MB_ICONEXCLAMATION, MB_ICONHAND, MB_ICONQUESTION, and MB_OK, all
described below.  The value -1 produces a “simple beep”; this is the final
fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise.
The sound parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with
SND_ALIAS.
The sound parameter is a sound association name from the registry.  If the
registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless
SND_NODEFAULT is also specified. If no default sound is registered,
raise RuntimeError. Do not use with SND_FILENAME.
All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems support many
more:
For example:
Play the sound repeatedly.  The SND_ASYNC flag must also be used to
avoid blocking.  Cannot be used with SND_MEMORY.
The sound parameter to PlaySound() is a memory image of a WAV file, as a
string.
Note
This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so a
combination of this flag and SND_ASYNC will raise RuntimeError.
Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.
Note
This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.
Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.
If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound.
Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.
Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.
Note
This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.
Play the SystemDefault sound.
Play the SystemExclamation sound.
Play the SystemHand sound.
Play the SystemQuestion sound.
Play the SystemDefault sound.
