[Security] Issue #26556: Update expat to 2.1.1, fixes CVE-2015-1283.
[Security] Fix TLS stripping vulnerability in smtplib, CVE-2016-0772.
Reported by Team Oststrom
Issue #21386: Implement missing IPv4Address.is_global property.  It was
documented since 07a5610bae9d.  Initial patch by Roger Luethi.
Issue #20900: distutils register command now decodes HTTP responses
correctly.  Initial patch by ingrid.
A new version of typing.py provides several new classes and
features: @overload outside stubs, Reversible, DefaultDict, Text,
ContextManager, Type[], NewType(), TYPE_CHECKING, and numerous bug
fixes (note that some of the new features are not yet implemented in
mypy or other static analyzers).  Also classes for PEP 492
(Awaitable, AsyncIterable, AsyncIterator) have been added (in fact
they made it into 3.5.1 but were never mentioned).
Issue #25738: Stop http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.send_error() from
sending a message body for 205 Reset Content.  Also, don’t send Content
header fields in responses that don’t have a body.  Patch by Susumu
Koshiba.
Issue #21313: Fix the “platform” module to tolerate when sys.version
contains truncated build information.
[Security] Issue #26839: On Linux, os.urandom() now calls
getrandom() with GRND_NONBLOCK to fall back on reading
/dev/urandom if the urandom entropy pool is not initialized yet. Patch
written by Colm Buckley.
Issue #27164: In the zlib module, allow decompressing raw Deflate streams
with a predefined zdict.  Based on patch by Xiang Zhang.
Issue #24291: Fix wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler to completely
write data to the client.  Previously it could do partial writes and
truncate data.  Also, wsgiref.handler.ServerHandler can now handle stdout
doing partial writes, but this is deprecated.
Issue #26809: Add __all__ to string.  Patch by Emanuel Barry.
Issue #26373: subprocess.Popen.communicate now correctly ignores
BrokenPipeError when the child process dies before .communicate()
is called in more/all circumstances.

Initial patch by Claudiu Popa.
Issue #27114: Fix SSLContext._load_windows_store_certs fails with
PermissionError
Issue #18383: Avoid creating duplicate filters when using filterwarnings
and simplefilter.  Based on patch by Alex Shkop.
Issue #27057: Fix os.set_inheritable() on Android, ioctl() is blocked by
SELinux and fails with EACCESS. The function now falls back to fcntl().
Patch written by Michał Bednarski.
Issue #27014: Fix infinite recursion using typing.py.  Thanks to Kalle Tuure!
Issue #14132: Fix urllib.request redirect handling when the target only has
a query string.  Original fix by Ján Janech.
Issue #17214: The “urllib.request” module now percent-encodes non-ASCII
bytes found in redirect target URLs.  Some servers send Location header
fields with non-ASCII bytes, but “http.client” requires the request target
to be ASCII-encodable, otherwise a UnicodeEncodeError is raised.  Based on
patch by Christian Heimes.
Issue #26892: Honor debuglevel flag in urllib.request.HTTPHandler. Patch
contributed by Chi Hsuan Yen.
Issue #22274: In the subprocess module, allow stderr to be redirected to

in statistics.pvariance.

instead of silently return incorrect result.

Issue #24114: Fix an uninitialized variable in ctypes.util.
The bug only occurs on SunOS when the ctypes implementation searches
for the crle program.  Patch by Xiang Zhang.  Tested on SunOS by
Kees Bos.
Issue #26864: In urllib.request, change the proxy bypass host checking
against no_proxy to be case-insensitive, and to not match unrelated host
names that happen to have a bypassed hostname as a suffix.  Patch by Xiang
Zhang.
Issue #26634: recursive_repr() now sets __qualname__ of wrapper.  Patch by
Xiang Zhang.
Issue #26804: urllib.request will prefer lower_case proxy environment
variables over UPPER_CASE or Mixed_Case ones. Patch contributed by Hans-Peter
Jansen.
Issue #26837: assertSequenceEqual() now correctly outputs non-stringified
differing items (like bytes in the -b mode).  This affects assertListEqual()
and assertTupleEqual().
Issue #26041: Remove “will be removed in Python 3.7” from deprecation
messages of platform.dist() and platform.linux_distribution().
Patch by Kumaripaba Miyurusara Athukorala.

Anthony Sottile.

1024 bytes per call.
Issue #16329: Add .webm to mimetypes.types_map.  Patch by Giampaolo Rodola’.

own SIGWINCH handler.  Patch by Eric Price.

large” if there are too many header fields to parse, rather than killing
the connection and raising an unhandled exception.  Patch by Xiang Zhang.
Issue #22854: Change BufferedReader.writable() and
BufferedWriter.readable() to always return False.
Issue #25195: Fix a regression in mock.MagicMock. _Call is a subclass of
tuple (changeset 3603bae63c13 only works for classes) so we need to
implement __ne__ ourselves.  Patch by Andrew Plummer.

Issue #15663: Update OS X 10.6+ installer to use Tcl/Tk 8.5.15.
Issue #19019: Change the OS X installer build script to use CFLAGS instead
of OPT for special build options.  By setting OPT, some compiler-specific
options like -fwrapv were overridden and thus not used, which could result
in broken interpreters when building with clang.
