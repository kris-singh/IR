The tokenize module provides a lexical scanner for Python source code,
implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as tokens
as well, making it useful for implementing “pretty-printers,” including
colorizers for on-screen displays.
To simplify token stream handling, all Operators and Delimiters
tokens are returned using the generic token.OP token type.  The exact
type can be determined by checking the exact_type property on the
named tuple returned from tokenize.tokenize().
The primary entry point is a generator:
The tokenize() generator requires one argument, readline, which
must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
io.IOBase.readline() method of file objects.  Each call to the
function should return one line of input as bytes.
The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and
the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item)
is the logical line; continuation lines are included.  The 5 tuple is
returned as a named tuple with the field names:
type string start end line.
The returned named tuple has an additional property named
exact_type that contains the exact operator type for
token.OP tokens.  For all other token types exact_type
equals the named tuple type field.
Changed in version 3.1: Added support for named tuples.
Changed in version 3.3: Added support for exact_type.
tokenize() determines the source encoding of the file by looking for a
UTF-8 BOM or encoding cookie, according to PEP 263.
All constants from the token module are also exported from
tokenize, as are three additional token type values:
Token value used to indicate a comment.
Token value used to indicate a non-terminating newline.  The NEWLINE token
indicates the end of a logical line of Python code; NL tokens are generated
when a logical line of code is continued over multiple physical lines.
Token value that indicates the encoding used to decode the source bytes
into text. The first token returned by tokenize() will always be an
ENCODING token.
Another function is provided to reverse the tokenization process. This is
useful for creating tools that tokenize a script, modify the token stream, and
write back the modified script.
Converts tokens back into Python source code.  The iterable must return
sequences with at least two elements, the token type and the token string.
Any additional sequence elements are ignored.
The reconstructed script is returned as a single string.  The result is
guaranteed to tokenize back to match the input so that the conversion is
lossless and round-trips are assured.  The guarantee applies only to the
token type and token string as the spacing between tokens (column
positions) may change.
It returns bytes, encoded using the ENCODING token, which is the first
token sequence output by tokenize().
tokenize() needs to detect the encoding of source files it tokenizes. The
function it uses to do this is available:
The detect_encoding() function is used to detect the encoding that
should be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument,
readline, in the same way as the tokenize() generator.
It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
(as a string) and a list of any lines (not decoded from bytes) it has read
in.
It detects the encoding from the presence of a UTF-8 BOM or an encoding
cookie as specified in PEP 263. If both a BOM and a cookie are present,
but disagree, a SyntaxError will be raised. Note that if the BOM is found,
'utf-8-sig' will be returned as an encoding.
If no encoding is specified, then the default of 'utf-8' will be
returned.
Use open() to open Python source files: it uses
detect_encoding() to detect the file encoding.
Open a file in read only mode using the encoding detected by
detect_encoding().
New in version 3.2.
Raised when either a docstring or expression that may be split over several
lines is not completed anywhere in the file, for example:
or:
Note that unclosed single-quoted strings do not cause an error to be
raised. They are tokenized as ERRORTOKEN, followed by the tokenization of
their contents.
New in version 3.3.
The tokenize module can be executed as a script from the command line.
It is as simple as:
The following options are accepted:
show this help message and exit
display token names using the exact type
If filename.py is specified its contents are tokenized to stdout.
Otherwise, tokenization is performed on stdin.
Example of a script rewriter that transforms float literals into Decimal
objects:
Example of tokenizing from the command line.  The script:
will be tokenized to the following output where the first column is the range
of the line/column coordinates where the token is found, the second column is
the name of the token, and the final column is the value of the token (if any)
The exact token type names can be displayed using the -e option:
32.6. keyword — Testing for Python keywords
32.8. tabnanny — Detection of ambiguous indentation
