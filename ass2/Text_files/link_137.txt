Content :New in version 3.4.
Source code: Lib/asyncio/
Note
The asyncio package has been included in the standard library on a
provisional basis. Backwards incompatible
changes (up to and including removal of the module) may occur if deemed
necessary by the core developers.
This module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent
code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other
resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.
Here is a more detailed list of the package contents:
Asynchronous programming is more complex than classical “sequential”
programming: see the Develop with asyncio page which lists
common traps and explains how to avoid them. Enable the debug mode during development to detect common issues.

The asyncio module was designed in PEP 3156. For a
motivational primer on transports and protocols, see PEP 3153.
