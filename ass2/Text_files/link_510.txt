Content :This subtype of PyObject represents a Python floating point object.
This instance of PyTypeObject represents the Python floating point
type.  This is the same object as float in the Python layer.
Return true if its argument is a PyFloatObject or a subtype of
PyFloatObject.
Return true if its argument is a PyFloatObject, but not a subtype of
PyFloatObject.
Create a PyFloatObject object based on the string value in str, or
NULL on failure.
Create a PyFloatObject object from v, or NULL on failure.
Return a C double representation of the contents of pyfloat.  If
pyfloat is not a Python floating point object but has a __float__()
method, this method will first be called to convert pyfloat into a float.
This method returns -1.0 upon failure, so one should call
PyErr_Occurred() to check for errors.
Return a C double representation of the contents of pyfloat, but
without error checking.
Return a structseq instance which contains information about the
precision, minimum and maximum values of a float. It’s a thin wrapper
around the header file float.h.
Return the maximum representable finite float DBL_MAX as C double.
Return the minimum normalized positive float DBL_MIN as C double.
Clear the float free list. Return the number of items that could not
be freed.
