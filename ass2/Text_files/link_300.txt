Content :This HOWTO discusses Python support for Unicode, and explains
various problems that people commonly encounter when trying to work
with Unicode.
In 1968, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, better known by
its acronym ASCII, was standardized.  ASCII defined numeric codes for various
characters, with the numeric values running from 0 to 127.  For example, the
lowercase letter ‘a’ is assigned 97 as its code value.
ASCII was an American-developed standard, so it only defined unaccented
characters.  There was an ‘e’, but no ‘é’ or ‘Í’.  This meant that languages
which required accented characters couldn’t be faithfully represented in ASCII.
(Actually the missing accents matter for English, too, which contains words such
as ‘naïve’ and ‘café’, and some publications have house styles which require
spellings such as ‘coöperate’.)
For a while people just wrote programs that didn’t display accents.
In the mid-1980s an Apple II BASIC program written by a French speaker
might have lines like these:
Those messages should contain accents (terminée, paramètre, enregistrés) and
they just look wrong to someone who can read French.
In the 1980s, almost all personal computers were 8-bit, meaning that bytes could
hold values ranging from 0 to 255.  ASCII codes only went up to 127, so some
machines assigned values between 128 and 255 to accented characters.  Different
machines had different codes, however, which led to problems exchanging files.
Eventually various commonly used sets of values for the 128–255 range emerged.
Some were true standards, defined by the International Standards Organization,
and some were de facto conventions that were invented by one company or
another and managed to catch on.
255 characters aren’t very many.  For example, you can’t fit both the accented
characters used in Western Europe and the Cyrillic alphabet used for Russian
into the 128–255 range because there are more than 128 such characters.
You could write files using different codes (all your Russian files in a coding
system called KOI8, all your French files in a different coding system called
Latin1), but what if you wanted to write a French document that quotes some
Russian text?  In the 1980s people began to want to solve this problem, and the
Unicode standardization effort began.
Unicode started out using 16-bit characters instead of 8-bit characters.  16
bits means you have 2^16 = 65,536 distinct values available, making it possible
to represent many different characters from many different alphabets; an initial
goal was to have Unicode contain the alphabets for every single human language.
It turns out that even 16 bits isn’t enough to meet that goal, and the modern
Unicode specification uses a wider range of codes, 0 through 1,114,111 (
0x10FFFF in base 16).
There’s a related ISO standard, ISO 10646.  Unicode and ISO 10646 were
originally separate efforts, but the specifications were merged with the 1.1
revision of Unicode.
(This discussion of Unicode’s history is highly simplified.  The
precise historical details aren’t necessary for understanding how to
use Unicode effectively, but if you’re curious, consult the Unicode
consortium site listed in the References or
the Wikipedia entry for Unicode
for more information.)
A character is the smallest possible component of a text.  ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’,
etc., are all different characters.  So are ‘È’ and ‘Í’.  Characters are
abstractions, and vary depending on the language or context you’re talking
about.  For example, the symbol for ohms (Ω) is usually drawn much like the
capital letter omega (Ω) in the Greek alphabet (they may even be the same in
some fonts), but these are two different characters that have different
meanings.
The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by code
points.  A code point is an integer value, usually denoted in base 16.  In the
standard, a code point is written using the notation U+12CA to mean the
character with value 0x12ca (4,810 decimal).  The Unicode standard contains
a lot of tables listing characters and their corresponding code points:
Strictly, these definitions imply that it’s meaningless to say ‘this is
character U+12CA‘.  U+12CA is a code point, which represents some particular
character; in this case, it represents the character ‘ETHIOPIC SYLLABLE WI’.  In
informal contexts, this distinction between code points and characters will
sometimes be forgotten.
A character is represented on a screen or on paper by a set of graphical
elements that’s called a glyph.  The glyph for an uppercase A, for example,
is two diagonal strokes and a horizontal stroke, though the exact details will
depend on the font being used.  Most Python code doesn’t need to worry about
glyphs; figuring out the correct glyph to display is generally the job of a GUI
toolkit or a terminal’s font renderer.
To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code
points, which are numbers from 0 through 0x10FFFF (1,114,111 decimal).  This
sequence needs to be represented as a set of bytes (meaning, values
from 0 through 255) in memory.  The rules for translating a Unicode string
into a sequence of bytes are called an encoding.
The first encoding you might think of is an array of 32-bit integers.  In this
representation, the string “Python” would look like this:
This representation is straightforward but using it presents a number of
problems.
Generally people don’t use this encoding, instead choosing other
encodings that are more efficient and convenient.  UTF-8 is probably
the most commonly supported encoding; it will be discussed below.
Encodings don’t have to handle every possible Unicode character, and most
encodings don’t.  The rules for converting a Unicode string into the ASCII
encoding, for example, are simple; for each code point:
Latin-1, also known as ISO-8859-1, is a similar encoding.  Unicode code points
0–255 are identical to the Latin-1 values, so converting to this encoding simply
requires converting code points to byte values; if a code point larger than 255
is encountered, the string can’t be encoded into Latin-1.
Encodings don’t have to be simple one-to-one mappings like Latin-1.  Consider
IBM’s EBCDIC, which was used on IBM mainframes.  Letter values weren’t in one
block: ‘a’ through ‘i’ had values from 129 to 137, but ‘j’ through ‘r’ were 145
through 153.  If you wanted to use EBCDIC as an encoding, you’d probably use
some sort of lookup table to perform the conversion, but this is largely an
internal detail.
UTF-8 is one of the most commonly used encodings.  UTF stands for “Unicode
Transformation Format”, and the ‘8’ means that 8-bit numbers are used in the
encoding.  (There are also a UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, but they are less
frequently used than UTF-8.)  UTF-8 uses the following rules:
UTF-8 has several convenient properties:
The Unicode Consortium site has character charts, a
glossary, and PDF versions of the Unicode specification.  Be prepared for some
difficult reading.  A chronology of the
origin and development of Unicode is also available on the site.
To help understand the standard, Jukka Korpela has written an introductory
guide to reading the
Unicode character tables.
Another good introductory article
was written by Joel Spolsky.
If this introduction didn’t make things clear to you, you should try
reading this alternate article before continuing.
Wikipedia entries are often helpful; see the entries for “character encoding” and UTF-8, for example.
Now that you’ve learned the rudiments of Unicode, we can look at Python’s
Unicode features.
Since Python 3.0, the language features a str type that contain Unicode
characters, meaning any string created using "unicode rocks!", 'unicode
rocks!', or the triple-quoted string syntax is stored as Unicode.
The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8, so you can simply
include a Unicode character in a string literal:
You can use a different encoding from UTF-8 by putting a specially-formatted
comment as the first or second line of the source code:
Side note: Python 3 also supports using Unicode characters in identifiers:
If you can’t enter a particular character in your editor or want to
keep the source code ASCII-only for some reason, you can also use
escape sequences in string literals. (Depending on your system,
you may see the actual capital-delta glyph instead of a u escape.)
In addition, one can create a string using the decode() method of
bytes.  This method takes an encoding argument, such as UTF-8,
and optionally an errors argument.
The errors argument specifies the response when the input string can’t be
converted according to the encoding’s rules.  Legal values for this argument are
'strict' (raise a UnicodeDecodeError exception), 'replace' (use
U+FFFD, REPLACEMENT CHARACTER), 'ignore' (just leave the
character out of the Unicode result), or 'backslashreplace' (inserts a
\xNN escape sequence).
The following examples show the differences:
Encodings are specified as strings containing the encoding’s name.  Python 3.2
comes with roughly 100 different encodings; see the Python Library Reference at
Standard Encodings for a list.  Some encodings have multiple names; for
example, 'latin-1', 'iso_8859_1' and '8859‘ are all synonyms for
the same encoding.
One-character Unicode strings can also be created with the chr()
built-in function, which takes integers and returns a Unicode string of length 1
that contains the corresponding code point.  The reverse operation is the
built-in ord() function that takes a one-character Unicode string and
returns the code point value:
The opposite method of bytes.decode() is str.encode(),
which returns a bytes representation of the Unicode string, encoded in the
requested encoding.
The errors parameter is the same as the parameter of the
decode() method but supports a few more possible handlers. As well as
'strict', 'ignore', and 'replace' (which in this case
inserts a question mark instead of the unencodable character), there is
also 'xmlcharrefreplace' (inserts an XML character reference),
backslashreplace (inserts a \uNNNN escape sequence) and
namereplace (inserts a \N{...} escape sequence).
The following example shows the different results:
The low-level routines for registering and accessing the available
encodings are found in the codecs module.  Implementing new
encodings also requires understanding the codecs module.
However, the encoding and decoding functions returned by this module
are usually more low-level than is comfortable, and writing new encodings
is a specialized task, so the module won’t be covered in this HOWTO.
In Python source code, specific Unicode code points can be written using the
\u escape sequence, which is followed by four hex digits giving the code
point.  The \U escape sequence is similar, but expects eight hex digits,
not four:
Using escape sequences for code points greater than 127 is fine in small doses,
but becomes an annoyance if you’re using many accented characters, as you would
in a program with messages in French or some other accent-using language.  You
can also assemble strings using the chr() built-in function, but this is
even more tedious.
Ideally, you’d want to be able to write literals in your language’s natural
encoding.  You could then edit Python source code with your favorite editor
which would display the accented characters naturally, and have the right
characters used at runtime.
Python supports writing source code in UTF-8 by default, but you can use almost
any encoding if you declare the encoding being used.  This is done by including
a special comment as either the first or second line of the source file:
The syntax is inspired by Emacs’s notation for specifying variables local to a
file.  Emacs supports many different variables, but Python only supports
‘coding’.  The -*- symbols indicate to Emacs that the comment is special;
they have no significance to Python but are a convention.  Python looks for
coding: name or coding=name in the comment.
If you don’t include such a comment, the default encoding used will be UTF-8 as
already mentioned.  See also PEP 263 for more information.
The Unicode specification includes a database of information about code points.
For each defined code point, the information includes the character’s
name, its category, the numeric value if applicable (Unicode has characters
representing the Roman numerals and fractions such as one-third and
four-fifths).  There are also properties related to the code point’s use in
bidirectional text and other display-related properties.
The following program displays some information about several characters, and
prints the numeric value of one particular character:
When run, this prints:
The category codes are abbreviations describing the nature of the character.
These are grouped into categories such as “Letter”, “Number”, “Punctuation”, or
“Symbol”, which in turn are broken up into subcategories.  To take the codes
from the above output, 'Ll' means ‘Letter, lowercase’, 'No' means
“Number, other”, 'Mn' is “Mark, nonspacing”, and 'So' is “Symbol,
other”.  See
the General Category Values section of the Unicode Character Database documentation for a
list of category codes.
The regular expressions supported by the re module can be provided
either as bytes or strings.  Some of the special character sequences such as
\d and \w have different meanings depending on whether
the pattern is supplied as bytes or a string.  For example,
\d will match the characters [0-9] in bytes but
in strings will match any character that’s in the 'Nd' category.
The string in this example has the number 57 written in both Thai and
Arabic numerals:
When executed, \d+ will match the Thai numerals and print them
out.  If you supply the re.ASCII flag to
compile(), \d+ will match the substring “57” instead.
Similarly, \w matches a wide variety of Unicode characters but
only [a-zA-Z0-9_] in bytes or if re.ASCII is supplied,
and \s will match either Unicode whitespace characters or
[ \t\n\r\f\v].
Some good alternative discussions of Python’s Unicode support are:
The str type is described in the Python library reference at
Text Sequence Type — str.
The documentation for the unicodedata module.
The documentation for the codecs module.
Marc-André Lemburg gave a presentation titled “Python and Unicode” (PDF slides) at
EuroPython 2002.  The slides are an excellent overview of the design of Python
2’s Unicode features (where the Unicode string type is called unicode and
literals start with u).
Once you’ve written some code that works with Unicode data, the next problem is
input/output.  How do you get Unicode strings into your program, and how do you
convert Unicode into a form suitable for storage or transmission?
It’s possible that you may not need to do anything depending on your input
sources and output destinations; you should check whether the libraries used in
your application support Unicode natively.  XML parsers often return Unicode
data, for example.  Many relational databases also support Unicode-valued
columns and can return Unicode values from an SQL query.
Unicode data is usually converted to a particular encoding before it gets
written to disk or sent over a socket.  It’s possible to do all the work
yourself: open a file, read an 8-bit bytes object from it, and convert the bytes
with bytes.decode(encoding).  However, the manual approach is not recommended.
One problem is the multi-byte nature of encodings; one Unicode character can be
represented by several bytes.  If you want to read the file in arbitrary-sized
chunks (say, 1024 or 4096 bytes), you need to write error-handling code to catch the case
where only part of the bytes encoding a single Unicode character are read at the
end of a chunk.  One solution would be to read the entire file into memory and
then perform the decoding, but that prevents you from working with files that
are extremely large; if you need to read a 2 GiB file, you need 2 GiB of RAM.
(More, really, since for at least a moment you’d need to have both the encoded
string and its Unicode version in memory.)
The solution would be to use the low-level decoding interface to catch the case
of partial coding sequences.  The work of implementing this has already been
done for you: the built-in open() function can return a file-like object
that assumes the file’s contents are in a specified encoding and accepts Unicode
parameters for methods such as read() and
write().  This works through open()‘s encoding and
errors parameters which are interpreted just like those in str.encode()
and bytes.decode().
Reading Unicode from a file is therefore simple:
It’s also possible to open files in update mode, allowing both reading and
writing:
The Unicode character U+FEFF is used as a byte-order mark (BOM), and is often
written as the first character of a file in order to assist with autodetection
of the file’s byte ordering.  Some encodings, such as UTF-16, expect a BOM to be
present at the start of a file; when such an encoding is used, the BOM will be
automatically written as the first character and will be silently dropped when
the file is read.  There are variants of these encodings, such as ‘utf-16-le’
and ‘utf-16-be’ for little-endian and big-endian encodings, that specify one
particular byte ordering and don’t skip the BOM.
In some areas, it is also convention to use a “BOM” at the start of UTF-8
encoded files; the name is misleading since UTF-8 is not byte-order dependent.
The mark simply announces that the file is encoded in UTF-8.  Use the
‘utf-8-sig’ codec to automatically skip the mark if present for reading such
files.
Most of the operating systems in common use today support filenames that contain
arbitrary Unicode characters.  Usually this is implemented by converting the
Unicode string into some encoding that varies depending on the system.  For
example, Mac OS X uses UTF-8 while Windows uses a configurable encoding; on
Windows, Python uses the name “mbcs” to refer to whatever the currently
configured encoding is.  On Unix systems, there will only be a filesystem
encoding if you’ve set the LANG or LC_CTYPE environment variables; if
you haven’t, the default encoding is UTF-8.
The sys.getfilesystemencoding() function returns the encoding to use on
your current system, in case you want to do the encoding manually, but there’s
not much reason to bother.  When opening a file for reading or writing, you can
usually just provide the Unicode string as the filename, and it will be
automatically converted to the right encoding for you:
Functions in the os module such as os.stat() will also accept Unicode
filenames.
The os.listdir() function returns filenames and raises an issue: should it return
the Unicode version of filenames, or should it return bytes containing
the encoded versions?  os.listdir() will do both, depending on whether you
provided the directory path as bytes or a Unicode string.  If you pass a
Unicode string as the path, filenames will be decoded using the filesystem’s
encoding and a list of Unicode strings will be returned, while passing a byte
path will return the filenames as bytes.  For example,
assuming the default filesystem encoding is UTF-8, running the following
program:
will produce the following output:
The first list contains UTF-8-encoded filenames, and the second list contains
the Unicode versions.
Note that on most occasions, the Unicode APIs should be used.  The bytes APIs
should only be used on systems where undecodable file names can be present,
i.e. Unix systems.
This section provides some suggestions on writing software that deals with
Unicode.
The most important tip is:
If you attempt to write processing functions that accept both Unicode and byte
strings, you will find your program vulnerable to bugs wherever you combine the
two different kinds of strings.  There is no automatic encoding or decoding: if
you do e.g. str + bytes, a TypeError will be raised.
When using data coming from a web browser or some other untrusted source, a
common technique is to check for illegal characters in a string before using the
string in a generated command line or storing it in a database.  If you’re doing
this, be careful to check the decoded string, not the encoded bytes data;
some encodings may have interesting properties, such as not being bijective
or not being fully ASCII-compatible.  This is especially true if the input
data also specifies the encoding, since the attacker can then choose a
clever way to hide malicious text in the encoded bytestream.
The StreamRecoder class can transparently convert between
encodings, taking a stream that returns data in encoding #1
and behaving like a stream returning data in encoding #2.
For example, if you have an input file f that’s in Latin-1, you
can wrap it with a StreamRecoder to return bytes encoded in
UTF-8:
What can you do if you need to make a change to a file, but don’t know
the file’s encoding?  If you know the encoding is ASCII-compatible and
only want to examine or modify the ASCII parts, you can open the file
with the surrogateescape error handler:
The surrogateescape error handler will decode any non-ASCII bytes
as code points in the Unicode Private Use Area ranging from U+DC80 to
U+DCFF.  These private code points will then be turned back into the
same bytes when the surrogateescape error handler is used when
encoding the data and writing it back out.
One section of Mastering Python 3 Input/Output,

The PDF slides for Marc-André Lemburg’s presentation “Writing Unicode-aware
Applications in Python”
discuss questions of character encodings as well as how to internationalize
and localize an application.  These slides cover Python 2.x only.
The Guts of Unicode in Python
is a PyCon 2013 talk by Benjamin Peterson that discusses the internal Unicode
representation in Python 3.3.
