abstract = {Understanding content popularity growth is of great importance to Internet service providers, content creators and online marketers. In this work, we characterize the growth patterns of video popularity on the currently most popular video sharing application, namely YouTube. Using newly provided data by the application, we analyze how the popularity of individual videos evolves since the video's upload time. Moreover, addressing a key aspect that has been mostly overlooked by previous work, we characterize the types of the referrers that most often attracted users to each video, aiming at shedding some light into the mechanisms (e.g., searching or external linking) that often drive users towards a video, and thus contribute to popularity growth. Our analyses are performed separately for three video datasets, namely, videos that appear in the YouTube top lists, videos removed from the system due to copyright violation, and videos selected according to random queries submitted to YouTube's search engine. Our results show that popularity growth patterns depend on the video dataset. In particular, copyright protected videos tend to get most of their views much earlier in their lifetimes, often exhibiting a popularity growth characterized by a viral epidemic-like propagation process. In contrast, videos in the top lists tend to experience sudden significant bursts of popularity. We also show that not only search but also other YouTube internal mechanisms play important roles to attract users to videos in all three datasets.},

abstract = {—Information Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed as an alternative design for the Internet with a focus on content centric communication rather than host-to-host commu-nication such as telnet or f tp. This requires the data to be cached or stored at intermediate routers to satisfy the future demands for the same contents locally. The existing caching policies are either suboptimal or not suitable for ICN networks. In this paper, we have proposed Universal Caching, a novel caching algorithm, along with a discrete time Markov Chain model based analysis to decide the cache size at a router in ICN networks. The proposed caching algorithm takes into account multiple parameters like distance from the content source, frequency of fetching the content, number of outgoing links at the intermediate router etc. To validate the proposed caching policy and the analytical model, we have conducted extensive simulations using MATLAB. Our simulation results show that the Universal Caching outperforms other caching policies like LRU and FIFO in terms of cache hits, access delay and cost of the link, etc.},

Written from a computer science perspective by three leading experts in the field, it gives an up-to-date treatment of all aspects of the design and implementation of systems for gathering, indexing, and searching documents; methods for evaluating systems; and an introduction to the use of machine learning methods on text collections. All the important ideas are explained using examples and figures, making it perfect for introductory courses in information retrieval for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science. Based on feedback from extensive classroom experience, the book has been carefully structured in order to make teaching more natural and effective. Although originally designed as the primary text for a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in information retrieval, the book will also create a buzz for researchers and professionals alike.},

abstract = {The convergence of the Internet, sensor networks, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems has ushered to the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) which is capable of connecting daily things, making them smart through sensing, reasoning, and cooperating with other things. Further, RFID technology enables tracking of an object and assigning it a unique ID. IoT has the potential for a wide range of applications relating to healthcare, environment, transportation, cities{\ldots} Moreover, the middleware is a basic component in the IoT architecture. It handles heterogeneity issues among IoT devices and provides a common framework for communication. More recently, the interest has focusing on developing publish/subscribe middleware systems for the IoT to allow asynchronous communication between the IoT devices. The scope of our paper is to study routing protocols for publish/subscribe schemes that include content and context-based routing. We propose an Energy-Efficient Content-Based Routing (EECBR) protocol for the IoT that minimizes the energy consumption. The proposed algorithm makes use of a virtual topology that is constructed in a centralized manner and then routes the events from the publishers to the intended interested subscribers in a distributed manner. EECBR has been simulated using Omnet++. The simulation results show that EECBR has a significant performance in term of the energy variance compared to the other schemes.},

abstract = {Many methods have been proposed for community detection in networks, but most of them do not take into account additional information on the nodes that is often available in practice. In this paper, we propose a new joint community detection criterion that uses both the network edge information and the node features to detect community structures. One advantage our method has over existing joint detection approaches is the flexibility of learning the impact of different features which may differ across communities. Another advantage is the flexibility of choosing the amount of influence the feature information has on communities. The method is asymptotically consistent under the block model with additional assumptions on the feature distributions, and performs well on simulated and real networks.},

To achieve the security goals in this new paradigm, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of ICN attacks, their classification, and proposed solutions. In this paper, we provide a survey of attacks unique to ICN architectures and other generic attacks that have an impact on ICN. It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. Finally, this paper presents the severity levels of ICN attacks and discusses the existing ICN security solutions.},

abstract = {—Content Centric Networking (CCN) has recently emerged as a promising architecture to deliver content at large-scale. It is based on named-data where a packet address names content and not its location. Then, the premise is to cache content on the network nodes along the delivery path. An important feature for CCN is therefore to manage the cache of the nodes. In this paper, we present Most Popular Content (MPC), a new caching strategy adapted to CCN networks. By caching only popular content, we show through extensive simulation experiments that MPC is able to cache less content while, at the same time, it still achieves a higher Cache Hit and outperforms existing default caching strategy in CCN.},

abstract = {Internet usage has drastically shifted from host-centric end-to-end communication to receiver-driven content retrieval. In order to adapt to this change, a handful of innovative information/content centric networking (ICN) architectures have recently been proposed. One common and important feature of these architectures is to leverage built-in network caches to improve the transmission efficiency of content dissemination. Compared with traditional Web Caching and CDN Caching, ICN Cache takes on several new characteristics: cache is transparent to applications, cache is ubiquitous, and content to be cached is more ine-grained. These distinguished features pose new challenges to ICN caching technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-art techniques aiming to address these issues, with particular focus on reducing cache redundancy and improving the availability of cached content. As a new research area, this paper also points out several interesting yet challenging research directions in this subject. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Example applications of this multi-view setting include clustering of Web pages which have an intrinsic view (the pages themselves) and an extrinsic view (e.g., anchor texts of inbound hyperlinks); multi-view learning has so far been studied in the context of classification. We develop and study partitioning and agglomerative, hierarchical multi-view clustering algorithms for text data. We find empirically that the multi-view versions of k-means and EM greatly improve on their single-view counterparts. By contrast, we obtain negative results for agglomerative hierarchical multi-view clustering. Our analysis explains this surprising phenomenon.},

This first-order Markov approach is used in conventional community detection, ranking and spreading analysis, although it ignores a potentially important feature of the dynamics: where flow moves to may depend on where it comes from. Here we analyse pathways from different systems, and although we only observe marginal consequences for disease spreading, we show that ignoring the effects of second-order Markov dynamics has important consequences for community detection, ranking and information spreading. For example, capturing dynamics with a second-order Markov model allows us to reveal actual travel patterns in air traffic and to uncover multidisciplinary journals in scientific communication. These findings were achieved only by using more available data and making no additional assumptions, and therefore suggest that accounting for higher-order memory in network flows can help us better understand how real systems are organized and function.},

abstract = {—With the growing realization that current Internet protocols are reaching the limits of their senescence, several on- going research efforts aim to design potential next-generation Internet architectures. Although they vary in maturity and scope, in order to avoid past pitfalls, these efforts seek to treat security and privacy as fundamental requirements. Resilience to Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks that plague today's Internet is a major issue for any new architecture and deserves full attention. In this paper, we focus on DoS in a specific candidate next- generation Internet architecture called Named Data Networking (NDN) – an instantiation of Content-Centric Networking ap- proach. By stressing content dissemination, NDN appears to be an attractive and viable approach to many types of current and emerging communication models. It also incorporates some basic security features that mitigate certain attacks. However, NDN's resilience to DoS attacks has not been analyzed to-date. This paper represents the first step towards assessment and possible mitigation of DoS in NDN. After identifying and analyzing several new types of attacks, it investigates their variations, effects and counter-measures. This paper also sheds some light on the debate about relative virtues of self-certifying, as opposed to human- readable, names in the context of content-centric networking.},

In this paper, we provide a survey of attacks unique to ICN architectures and other generic attacks that have an impact on ICN. It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. Finally, this paper presents the severity levels of ICN attacks and discusses the existing ICN security solutions.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Web has promoted a growing interest in social network analysis, such as community detection. Among many different community detection approaches, there are two kinds that we want to address: one considers the graph structure of the network (topology-based community detection approach); the other one takes the textual information of the network nodes into consideration (topic-based community detection approach). This paper conducted systematic analysis of applying a topology-based community detection approach and a topic-based community detection approach to the coauthorship networks of the information retrieval area and found that: (1) communities detected by the topology-based community detection approach tend to contain different topics within each community; and (2) communities detected by the topic-based community detection approach tend to contain topologically-diverse sub-communities within each community. The future community detection approaches should not only emphasize the relationship between communities and topics, but also consider the dynamic changes of communities and topics. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {There is an extensive class of Web applications that involve predicting user responses to options. Such a facility is called a recommendation system. We shall begin this chapter with a survey of the most important examples of these systems. However, to bring the problem into focus, two good examples of recommendation systems are: 1. Offering news articles to on-line newspaper readers, based on a prediction of reader interests. 2. Offering customers of an on-line retailer suggestions about what they might like to buy, based on their past history of purchases and/or product searches. Recommendation systems use a number of different technologies. We can classify these systems into two broad groups. • Content-based systems examine properties of the items recommended. For instance, if a Netflix user has watched many cowboy movies, then recom-mend a movie classified in the database as having the " cowboy " genre. • Collaborative filtering systems recommend items based on similarity mea-sures between users and/or items. The items recommended to a user are those preferred by similar users. This sort of recommendation system can use the groundwork laid in Chapter 3 on similarity search and Chapter 7 on clustering. However, these technologies by themselves are not suffi-cient, and there are some new algorithms that have proven effective for recommendation systems. 9.1 A Model for Recommendation Systems In this section we introduce a model for recommendation systems, based on a utility matrix of preferences. We introduce the concept of a " long-tail, " 307 308 CHAPTER 9. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS which explains the advantage of on-line vendors over conventional, brick-and-mortar vendors. We then briefly survey the sorts of applications in which recommendation systems have proved useful. 9.1.1 The Utility Matrix In a recommendation-system application there are two classes of entities, which we shall refer to as users and items. Users have preferences for certain items, and these preferences must be teased out of the data. The data itself is repre-sented as a utility matrix, giving for each user-item pair, a value that represents what is known about the degree of preference of that user for that item. Values come from an ordered set, e.g., integers 1–5 representing the number of stars that the user gave as a rating for that item. We assume that the matrix is sparse, meaning that most entries are " unknown. " An unknown rating implies that we have no explicit information about the user's preference for the item. Example 9.1 : In Fig. 9.1 we see an example utility matrix, representing users' ratings of movies on a 1–5 scale, with 5 the highest rating. Blanks represent the situation where the user has not rated the movie. The movie names are HP1, HP2, and HP3 for Harry Potter I, II, and III, TW for Twilight, and SW1, SW2, and SW3 for Star Wars episodes 1, 2, and 3. The users are represented by capital letters A through D.},

The framework is used to compare the performance of optimal caching everywhere in an ICN with opportunistic caching of content only near its consumers. This comparison is made using the independent reference model adopted in all prior studies, as well as a new model that captures non-stationary reference locality in space and time. The results obtained analytically and from simulations show that opti-mal caching throughout an ICN and opportunistic caching at the edge routers of an ICN perform comparably the same. In addition, caching content opportunistically only near its consumers is shown to outperform the traditional on-path caching approach assumed in most ICN architectures in an unstructured network with arbitrary topology represented as a random geometric graph.},

abstract = {Contextual bandit algorithms have become popular tools in online recommendation and advertising systems. Offline evaluation of the effectiveness of new algorithms in these applications is critical for protecting online user experiences but very challenging due to their “partial-label” nature. A common practice is to create a simulator which simulates the online environment for the problem at hand and then run an algorithm against this simulator. However, creating the simulator itself is often difficult and modeling bias is usually unavoidably introduced. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we review a recently proposed offline evaluation technique. Different from simulator-based approaches, the method is completely data-driven, is easy to adapt to different applications, and more importantly, provides provably unbiased evaluations. We argue for the wide use of this technique as standard practice when comparing bandit algorithms in real-life problems. Second, as an application of this technique, we compare and validate a number of new algorithms based on generalized linear models. Experiments using real Yahoo! data suggest substantial improvement over algorithms with linear models when the rewards are binary.},

We compare the quality of the algorithms with respect to a number of structural quality functions and a logical quality measure which assesses the ability of the algorithms to separate ham and spam emails by clustering them into distinct com-munities. Our study reveals that the algorithms that perform well with respect to structural quality, don't achieve high logical quality. We also show that the algorithms with similar structural quality also have similar logical quality regardless of their approach to clustering. Finally, we re-veal that the algorithm that performs link community detection is more suitable for clustering email networks than the node-based approaches, and it creates more distinct communities of ham and spam edges.},

This challenge can be faced either by boosting the capacity of the network infrastructure, or by means of offloading traffic from the backhaul and core network and serving contents from distributed cache servers close to the users. Network operators can extend the coverage of traditional CDNs by making usage of caching locations much closer to the users than traditional CDNs. Additionally, network operators can optimize the caching and delivery of contents by exploiting the complete knowledge of their network for designing a cost-effective infrastructure able to achieve both improved user satisfaction and cost savings. This article provides thoroughly justified design principles for a highly distributed operator-owned CDN while focusing on four key aspects: the optimal location of cache servers, mechanisms for request routing, content replica placement, and content outsourcing and retrieval.},

One advantage our method has over existing joint detection approaches is the flexibility of learning the impact of different features which may differ across communities. Another advantage is the flexibility of choosing the amount of influence the feature information has on communities. The method is asymptotically consistent under the block model with additional assumptions on the feature distributions, and performs well on simulated and real networks.},

abstract = {Understanding content popularity growth is of great importance to Internet service providers, content creators and online marketers. In this work, we characterize the growth patterns of video popularity on the currently most popular video sharing application, namely YouTube. Using newly provided data by the application, we analyze how the popularity of individual videos evolves since the video's upload time. Moreover, addressing a key aspect that has been mostly overlooked by previous work, we characterize the types of the referrers that most often attracted users to each video, aiming at shedding some light into the mechanisms (e.g., searching or external linking) that often drive users towards a video, and thus contribute to popularity growth. Our analyses are performed separately for three video datasets, namely, videos that appear in the YouTube top lists, videos removed from the system due to copyright violation, and videos selected according to random queries submitted to YouTube's search engine. Our results show that popularity growth patterns depend on the video dataset. In particular, copyright protected videos tend to get most of their views much earlier in their lifetimes, often exhibiting a popularity growth characterized by a viral epidemic-like propagation process. In contrast, videos in the top lists tend to experience sudden significant bursts of popularity. We also show that not only search but also other YouTube internal mechanisms play important roles to attract users to videos in all three datasets.},

abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) is a new communication paradigm that focuses on content retrieval from a network regardless of the storage location or physical representation of this content. In ICN, securing the content itself is much more important than securing the infrastructure or the endpoints. To achieve the security goals in this new paradigm, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of ICN attacks, their classification, and proposed solutions. In this paper, we provide a survey of attacks unique to ICN architectures and other generic attacks that have an impact on ICN. It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. Finally, this paper presents the severity levels of ICN attacks and discusses the existing ICN security solutions.},

Although very popular, the continuous growth of such applications poses novel performance and scalability challenges. Information-centric networks put content at the center, and propose novel solutions to such challenges but also pose new questions on the interface between caching and routing. In this paper, building on top of Q-routing we propose a caching strategy, namely Q-caching, which leverages information that is already collected by the routing algorithm. Q-caching promotes content diversity in the network, reducing the load at custodians and average download times for clients. In stylized topologies, we show that the gains of Q-caching against state-of-the-art algorithms are significant. We then consider the RNP topology, and show that Q-caching performance is more flexible while competitive when compared against existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Although biological invasions pose serious threats to biodiversity, they also provide the opportunity to better understand interactions between the ecological and evolutionary processes structuring populations and communities. However, ecoevolutionary frameworks for studying species invasions are lacking. We propose using game theory and the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) as a conceptual framework for integrating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of invasions. We suggest that the pathways by which a recipient community may have no ESS provide mechanistic hypotheses for how such communities may be vulnerable to invasion and how invaders can exploit these vulnerabilities. We distinguish among these pathways by formalizing the evolutionary contexts of the invader relative to the recipient community. We model both the ecological and the adaptive dynamics of the interacting species. We show how the ESS concept provides new mechanistic hypotheses for when invasions result in long- or short-term increases in biodiversity, species replacement, and subsequent evolutionary changes.},

abstract = {In-network caching necessitates the transformation of cen- tralised operations of traditional, overlay caching techniques to a decentralised and uncoordinated environment. Given that caching capacity in routers is relatively small in com- parison to the amount of forwarded content, a key aspect is balanced distribution of content among the available caches. In this paper, we are concerned with decentralised, real-time distribution of content in router caches. Our goal is to reduce caching redundancy and in turn, make more efficient utili- sation of available cache resources along a delivery path. Our in-network caching scheme, called ProbCache, ap- proximates the caching capability of a path and caches con- tents probabilistically in order to: i) leave caching space for other flows sharing (part of) the same path, and ii) fairly multiplex contents of different flows among caches of a shared path. We compare our algorithm against universal caching and against schemes proposed in the past for Web-Caching ar- chitectures, such as Leave Copy Down (LCD). Our results show reduction of up to 20{\%} in server hits, and up to 10{\%} in the number of hops required to hit cached contents, but, most importantly, reduction of cache-evictions by an order of magnitude in comparison to universal caching.},

In this paper, we propose a new joint community detection criterion that uses both the network edge information and the node features to detect community structures. One advantage our method has over existing joint detection approaches is the flexibility of learning the impact of different features which may differ across communities. Another advantage is the flexibility of choosing the amount of influence the feature information has on communities. The method is asymptotically consistent under the block model with additional assumptions on the feature distributions, and performs well on simulated and real networks.},

abstract = {Abstract Caching is widely used to reduce network traffic and improve user experience. Traditionally caches store complete objects, but video files and the recent emergence of information-centric networking have highlighted a need for understanding how partial caching could be beneficial. In partial caching, objects are divided into chunks which are cached either independently or by exploiting common properties of chunks of the same file. In this paper, we identify why partial caching is beneficial, and propose a way to quantify the benefit. We develop an optimal n-Chunking algorithm with complexity O({\textless}sup{\textgreater}ns2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) for an s-byte file, and compare it with ???-optimal homogeneous chunking, where ??? is bounded by O(n-{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Our analytical results and comparison lead to the surprising conclusion that neither sophisticated partial caching algorithm nor high complexity optimal chunking are needed in information-centric networks. Instead, simple utility-based in-network caching algorithm and low complexity homogeneous chunking are sufficient to achieve the most benefits of partial caching.},

abstract = {Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.},

The scope of our paper is to study routing protocols for publish/subscribe schemes that include content and context-based routing. We propose an Energy-Efficient Content-Based Routing (EECBR) protocol for the IoT that minimizes the energy consumption. The proposed algorithm makes use of a virtual topology that is constructed in a centralized manner and then routes the events from the publishers to the intended interested subscribers in a distributed manner. EECBR has been simulated using Omnet++. The simulation results show that EECBR has a significant performance in term of the energy variance compared to the other schemes.},

abstract = {Internet usage has drastically shifted from host-centric end-to-end communication to receiver-driven content retrieval. In order to adapt to this change, a handful of innovative information/content centric networking (ICN) architectures have recently been proposed. One common and important feature of these architectures is to leverage built-in network caches to improve the transmission efficiency of content dissemination. Compared with traditional Web Caching and CDN Caching, ICN Cache takes on several new characteristics: cache is transparent to applications, cache is ubiquitous, and content to be cached is more ine-grained. These distinguished features pose new challenges to ICN caching technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-art techniques aiming to address these issues, with particular focus on reducing cache redundancy and improving the availability of cached content. As a new research area, this paper also points out several interesting yet challenging research directions in this subject. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A formal framework is presented for the characterization of cache allocation models in Information-Centric Networks (ICN). The framework is used to compare the performance of optimal caching everywhere in an ICN with opportunistic caching of content only near its consumers. This comparison is made using the independent reference model adopted in all prior studies, as well as a new model that captures non-stationary reference locality in space and time. The results obtained analytically and from simulations show that opti-mal caching throughout an ICN and opportunistic caching at the edge routers of an ICN perform comparably the same. In addition, caching content opportunistically only near its consumers is shown to outperform the traditional on-path caching approach assumed in most ICN architectures in an unstructured network with arbitrary topology represented as a random geometric graph.},

We report on the first NDN experiments in a life-size IoT deployment, spread over tens of rooms on several floors of a building. Based on the insights gained with these experiments, the report analyses the shortcomings of CCN applied to IoT. Several interoperable CCN enhancements are then proposed and evaluated. We significantly decreased control traffic (i.e., interest messages) and leverage data path and caching to match IoT requirements in terms of energy and bandwidth constraints. Our optimizations increase content availability in case of IoT nodes with intermittent activity. This report also provides the first experimental comparison of CCN with the common IoT standards 6LoWPAN/RPL/UDP.},

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) is a new communication paradigm that focuses on content retrieval from a network regardless of the storage location or physical representation of this content. In ICN, securing the content itself is much more important than securing the infrastructure or the endpoints. To achieve the security goals in this new paradigm, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of ICN attacks, their classification, and proposed solutions. In this paper, we provide a survey of attacks unique to ICN architectures and other generic attacks that have an impact on ICN. It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. Finally, this paper presents the severity levels of ICN attacks and discusses the existing ICN security solutions.},

@article{Blasco2014,
abstract = {Optimal cache content placement in a wireless small cell base station (sBS) with limited backhaul capacity is studied. The sBS has a large cache memory and provides content-level selective offloading by delivering high data rate contents to users in its coverage area. The goal of the sBS content controller (CC) is to store the most popular contents in the sBS cache memory such that the maximum amount of data can be fetched directly form the sBS, not relying on the limited backhaul resources during peak traffic periods. If the popularity profile is known in advance, the problem reduces to a knapsack problem. However, it is assumed in this work that, the popularity profile of the files is not known by the CC, and it can only observe the instantaneous demand for the cached content. Hence, the cache content placement is optimised based on the demand history. By refreshing the cache content at regular time intervals, the CC tries to learn the popularity profile, while exploiting the limited cache capacity in the best way possible. Three algorithms are studied for this cache content placement problem, leading to different exploitation-exploration trade-offs. We provide extensive numerical simulations in order to study the time-evolution of these algorithms, and the impact of the system parameters, such as the number of files, the number of users, the cache size, and the skewness of the popularity profile, on the performance. It is shown that the proposed algorithms quickly learn the popularity profile for a wide range of system parameters.},

abstract = {—Information Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed as an alternative design for the Internet with a focus on content centric communication rather than host-to-host commu-nication such as telnet or f tp. This requires the data to be cached or stored at intermediate routers to satisfy the future demands for the same contents locally. The existing caching policies are either suboptimal or not suitable for ICN networks. In this paper, we have proposed Universal Caching, a novel caching algorithm, along with a discrete time Markov Chain model based analysis to decide the cache size at a router in ICN networks. The proposed caching algorithm takes into account multiple parameters like distance from the content source, frequency of fetching the content, number of outgoing links at the intermediate router etc. To validate the proposed caching policy and the analytical model, we have conducted extensive simulations using MATLAB. Our simulation results show that the Universal Caching outperforms other caching policies like LRU and FIFO in terms of cache hits, access delay and cost of the link, etc.},

Community detection is an important problem in the field of complex networks and is useful in a variety of applications such as information propagation, link prediction, recommendation, and marketing. In this study, we focus on discovering overlapping community structures by using link partitions. We propose a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-Based Link Partition (LBLP) method, which can find communities with an adjustable range of overlapping. This method employs the LDA model to detect link partitions, which can calculate the community belonging factor for each link. On the basis of this factor, link partitions with bridge links can be found efficiently. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution by using both real-world and synthesized networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach can find a meaningful and relevant link community structure.},
