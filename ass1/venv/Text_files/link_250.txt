The pyclbr module can be used to determine some limited information
about the classes, methods and top-level functions defined in a module.  The
information provided is sufficient to implement a traditional three-pane
class browser.  The information is extracted from the source code rather
than by importing the module, so this module is safe to use with untrusted
code.  This restriction makes it impossible to use this module with modules
not implemented in Python, including all standard and optional extension
modules.
Read a module and return a dictionary mapping class names to class
descriptor objects.  The parameter module should be the name of a
module as a string; it may be the name of a module within a package.  The
path parameter should be a sequence, and is used to augment the value
of sys.path, which is used to locate module source code.
Like readmodule(), but the returned dictionary, in addition to
mapping class names to class descriptor objects, also maps top-level
function names to function descriptor objects.  Moreover, if the module
being read is a package, the key '__path__' in the returned
dictionary has as its value a list which contains the package search
path.
The Class objects used as values in the dictionary returned by
readmodule() and readmodule_ex() provide the following data
attributes:
The name of the module defining the class described by the class descriptor.
The name of the class.
A list of Class objects which describe the immediate base
classes of the class being described.  Classes which are named as
superclasses but which are not discoverable by readmodule() are
listed as a string with the class name instead of as Class
objects.
A dictionary mapping method names to line numbers.
Name of the file containing the class statement defining the class.
The line number of the class statement within the file named by
file.
The Function objects used as values in the dictionary returned by
readmodule_ex() provide the following attributes:
The name of the module defining the function described by the function
descriptor.
The name of the function.
Name of the file containing the def statement defining the function.
The line number of the def statement within the file named by
file.
