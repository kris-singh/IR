Content :This module provides direct access to all ‘built-in’ identifiers of Python; for
example, builtins.open is the full name for the built-in function
open().  See Built-in Functions and Built-in Constants for
documentation.
This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can be
useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value,
but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For example, in a module
that wants to implement an open() function that wraps the built-in
open(), this module can be used directly:
As an implementation detail, most modules have the name __builtins__ made
available as part of their globals.  The value of __builtins__ is normally
either this module or the value of this module’s __dict__ attribute.
Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate
implementations of Python.
