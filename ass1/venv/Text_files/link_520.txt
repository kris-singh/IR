Content :An instance method is a wrapper for a PyCFunction and the new way
to bind a PyCFunction to a class object. It replaces the former call
PyMethod_New(func, NULL, class).
This instance of PyTypeObject represents the Python instance
method type. It is not exposed to Python programs.
Return true if o is an instance method object (has type
PyInstanceMethod_Type).  The parameter must not be NULL.
Return a new instance method object, with func being any callable object
func is the function that will be called when the instance method is
called.
Return the function object associated with the instance method im.
Macro version of PyInstanceMethod_Function() which avoids error checking.
Methods are bound function objects. Methods are always bound to an instance of
a user-defined class. Unbound methods (methods bound to a class object) are
no longer available.
This instance of PyTypeObject represents the Python method type.  This
is exposed to Python programs as types.MethodType.
Return true if o is a method object (has type PyMethod_Type).  The
parameter must not be NULL.
Return a new method object, with func being any callable object and self
the instance the method should be bound. func is the function that will
be called when the method is called. self must not be NULL.
Return the function object associated with the method meth.
Macro version of PyMethod_Function() which avoids error checking.
Return the instance associated with the method meth.
Macro version of PyMethod_Self() which avoids error checking.
Clear the free list. Return the total number of freed items.
