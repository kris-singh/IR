Iterating over a message object tree is fairly easy with the
Message.walk method.  The
email.iterators module provides some useful higher level iterations over
message object trees.
This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of msg, returning the
string payloads line-by-line.  It skips over all the subpart headers, and it
skips over any subpart with a payload that isn’t a Python string.  This is
somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the message from
a file using readline(), skipping over all the
intervening headers.
Optional decode is passed through to Message.get_payload.
This iterates over all the subparts of msg, returning only those subparts that
match the MIME type specified by maintype and subtype.
Note that subtype is optional; if omitted, then subpart MIME type matching is
done only with the main type.  maintype is optional too; it defaults to
text.
Thus, by default typed_subpart_iterator() returns each subpart that has a
MIME type of text/*.
The following function has been added as a useful debugging tool.  It should
not be considered part of the supported public interface for the package.
Prints an indented representation of the content types of the message object
structure.  For example:
Optional fp is a file-like object to print the output to.  It must be
suitable for Python’s print() function.  level is used internally.
include_default, if true, prints the default type as well.
