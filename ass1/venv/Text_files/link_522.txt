Content :Code objects are a low-level detail of the CPython implementation.
Each one represents a chunk of executable code that hasn’t yet been
bound into a function.
The C structure of the objects used to describe code objects.  The
fields of this type are subject to change at any time.
This is an instance of PyTypeObject representing the Python
code type.
Return true if co is a code object.
Return the number of free variables in co.
Return a new code object.  If you need a dummy code object to
create a frame, use PyCode_NewEmpty() instead.  Calling
PyCode_New() directly can bind you to a precise Python
version since the definition of the bytecode changes often.
Return a new empty code object with the specified filename,
function name, and first line number.  It is illegal to
exec() or eval() the resulting code object.
