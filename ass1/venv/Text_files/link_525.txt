Content :Python provides two general-purpose iterator objects.  The first, a sequence
iterator, works with an arbitrary sequence supporting the __getitem__()
method.  The second works with a callable object and a sentinel value, calling
the callable for each item in the sequence, and ending the iteration when the
sentinel value is returned.
Type object for iterator objects returned by PySeqIter_New() and the
one-argument form of the iter() built-in function for built-in sequence
types.
Return true if the type of op is PySeqIter_Type.
Return an iterator that works with a general sequence object, seq.  The
iteration ends when the sequence raises IndexError for the subscripting
operation.
Type object for iterator objects returned by PyCallIter_New() and the
two-argument form of the iter() built-in function.
Return true if the type of op is PyCallIter_Type.
Return a new iterator.  The first parameter, callable, can be any Python
callable object that can be called with no parameters; each call to it should
return the next item in the iteration.  When callable returns a value equal to
sentinel, the iteration will be terminated.
