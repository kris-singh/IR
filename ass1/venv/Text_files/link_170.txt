Content :Source code: Lib/urllib/error.py
The urllib.error module defines the exception classes for exceptions
raised by urllib.request.  The base exception class is URLError.
The following exceptions are raised by urllib.error as appropriate:
The handlers raise this exception (or derived exceptions) when they run into
a problem.  It is a subclass of OSError.
The reason for this error.  It can be a message string or another
exception instance.
Changed in version 3.3: URLError has been made a subclass of OSError instead
of IOError.
Though being an exception (a subclass of URLError), an
HTTPError can also function as a non-exceptional file-like return
value (the same thing that urlopen() returns).  This
is useful when handling exotic HTTP errors, such as requests for
authentication.
An HTTP status code as defined in RFC 2616.  This numeric value corresponds
to a value found in the dictionary of codes as found in
http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.responses.
This is usually a string explaining the reason for this error.
The HTTP response headers for the HTTP request that caused the
HTTPError.
New in version 3.4.
This exception is raised when the urlretrieve()
function detects that
the amount of the downloaded data is less than the expected amount (given by
the Content-Length header).  The content attribute stores the
downloaded (and supposedly truncated) data.
