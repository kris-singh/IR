Content :Return 1 if the object provides mapping protocol, and 0 otherwise.  This
function always succeeds.
Returns the number of keys in object o on success, and -1 on failure.  For
objects that do not provide mapping protocol, this is equivalent to the Python
expression len(o).
Remove the mapping for object key from the object o. Return -1 on
failure.  This is equivalent to the Python statement del o[key].
Remove the mapping for object key from the object o. Return -1 on
failure.  This is equivalent to the Python statement del o[key].
On success, return 1 if the mapping object has the key key and 0
otherwise.  This is equivalent to the Python expression key in o.
This function always succeeds.
Return 1 if the mapping object has the key key and 0 otherwise.  This
is equivalent to the Python expression key in o.  This function always
succeeds.
On success, return a list, a tuple or a dictionary view in case of a dict,
of the keys in object o. On failure, return NULL.
On success, return a list, a tuple or a dictionary view in case of a dict, of
the values in object o. On failure, return NULL.
On success, return a list, a tuple or a dictionary view in case of a dict, of
the items in object o, where each item is a tuple containing a key-value
pair.  On failure, return NULL.
Return element of o corresponding to the object key or NULL on failure.
This is the equivalent of the Python expression o[key].
Map the object key to the value v in object o. Returns -1 on failure.
This is the equivalent of the Python statement o[key] = v.
