The tkinter.scrolledtext module provides a class of the same name which
implements a basic text widget which has a vertical scroll bar configured to do
the “right thing.”  Using the ScrolledText class is a lot easier than
setting up a text widget and scroll bar directly.  The constructor is the same
as that of the tkinter.Text class.
The text widget and scrollbar are packed together in a Frame, and the
methods of the Grid and Pack geometry managers are acquired
from the Frame object.  This allows the ScrolledText widget to
be used directly to achieve most normal geometry management behavior.
Should more specific control be necessary, the following attributes are
available:
The frame which surrounds the text and scroll bar widgets.
The scroll bar widget.
