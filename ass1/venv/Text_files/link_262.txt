Content :This module provides access to the Unix group database. It is available on all
Unix versions.
Group database entries are reported as a tuple-like object, whose attributes
correspond to the members of the group structure (Attribute field below, see
<pwd.h>):
The gid is an integer, name and password are strings, and the member list is a
list of strings. (Note that most users are not explicitly listed as members of
the group they are in according to the password database.  Check both databases
to get complete membership information.  Also note that a gr_name that
starts with a + or - is likely to be a YP/NIS reference and may not be
accessible via getgrnam() or getgrgid().)
It defines the following items:
Return the group database entry for the given numeric group ID. KeyError
is raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.
Return the group database entry for the given group name. KeyError is
raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.
Return a list of all available group entries, in arbitrary order.
